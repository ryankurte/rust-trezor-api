# Rust Trezor API

A fork of a [fork](https://github.com/joshieDo/rust-trezor-api) of a [fork](https://github.com/romanz/rust-trezor-api) of a [lib](https://github.com/stevenroose/rust-trezor-api), which provides a way to communicate with a Trezor device from a rust project.

Prior iterations have typically been focused on supporting a specific coin, this is intended to separate coin implementations from client logic to improve maintainability going forward.
